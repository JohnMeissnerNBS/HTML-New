/*

You will want to break your code up into three sections

* Variables (let element = 1)
* Methods (when the event listener notices an input the method will take a relevant action)
* Event listeners (these are thing that listen for input i.e. clicks, typing etc)

You will also want to keep your script modulal so that it is easier to see what does what

DOMs (Document Object Model)

This is a model of your webpage so it will be a bit like a flow chart which breaks down different parts of the webpage.

JavaScript is part of the EcmaScript structure and isnt native to HTML

An API is "application programming interface"

It is a contract of specified behaviours that we have to adhere by.

The DOM API is part of the browser

You should try and keep as much of the page seperated as possible. So for example it is good to have a section for style(CSS), section for variables, section for functions, section for eventlisteners etc
